# Interactive Broker Trading App - Project Plan

## Project Overview
Build a terminal-based trading application that connects to Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation (TWS) using the rust-ibapi crate. The app will enable users to check positions, monitor real-time prices, execute trades, and track P&L with a clean, color-coded terminal interface.

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Rust
- **Main Dependency**: ibapi crate (v1.2.2)
- **Runtime**: Tokio for async operations
- **UI**: Terminal-based with colored output
- **Connection**: TWS API on port 7500 (configurable)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Connection (Week 1)
**Goal**: Establish a stable, production-ready connection to TWS with proper error handling

- Set up proper project structure with modular architecture
- Fix existing compilation errors in trade.rs and main.rs
- Implement robust TWS connection with retry logic
- Create connection manager module
- Add configuration management using environment variables
- Implement comprehensive logging system (log4rs or tracing)
- Create error handling framework
- Set up development environment documentation

### Phase 2: Core Trading Functionality (Week 2)
**Goal**: Implement all core trading operations with TWS

- Implement ticker symbol input and validation
- Create position checking functionality
- Build real-time price retrieval system
- Implement market order placement (buy/sell)
- Add position tracking with live P&L calculation
- Create portfolio value monitoring
- Implement order status tracking
- Add trade execution confirmation system

### Phase 3: Terminal UI Implementation (Week 3)
**Goal**: Create an intuitive, real-time terminal interface

- Implement terminal clearing and refresh system
- Add colored output support:
  - Red for losses
  - Green for profits
  - Orange for current price
  - White for prompts
- Build interactive prompt system for user decisions
- Design three-line status display:
  - Line 1: P&L display
  - Line 2: Current price and symbol
  - Line 3: Action prompt (Buy/Sell)
- Implement real-time UI updates during position holding
- Add keyboard interrupt handling for clean exit
- Create status messages and notifications

### Phase 4: Testing & Error Handling (Week 4)
**Goal**: Ensure reliability and safety of trading operations

- Create comprehensive unit tests for each module
- Build integration tests for TWS connection
- Implement mock TWS connection for testing
- Add edge case handling:
  - Connection loss recovery
  - Invalid ticker symbols
  - Market closed scenarios
  - Insufficient funds
- Implement paper trading mode
- Test with various market conditions
- Validate P&L calculations accuracy
- Add transaction logging and audit trail

### Phase 5: Enhancement & Documentation (Week 5)
**Goal**: Polish the application for production use

- Add command-line argument parsing (clap)
- Implement multiple asset support
- Add configuration profiles (paper/live trading)
- Create comprehensive README with:
  - Installation instructions
  - TWS setup guide
  - Usage examples
  - Troubleshooting section
- Add performance monitoring
- Implement graceful shutdown procedures
- Create Docker container (optional)
- Final testing and bug fixes

## Success Criteria
1. **Connectivity**: Reliable connection to TWS with automatic reconnection
2. **Accuracy**: Correct position tracking and P&L calculations
3. **Usability**: Clear, responsive terminal interface
4. **Safety**: Proper error handling and confirmation prompts
5. **Testing**: >80% test coverage with all critical paths tested
6. **Documentation**: Complete setup and usage documentation

## Risk Mitigation
- **API Changes**: Pin ibapi version, monitor for updates
- **Connection Issues**: Implement exponential backoff retry
- **Data Accuracy**: Validate all financial calculations with test cases
- **User Errors**: Add confirmation prompts for all trades
- **Market Risks**: Default to paper trading mode

## Milestones
- **M1**: Working TWS connection with basic operations
- **M2**: Complete trading functionality with position management
- **M3**: Fully functional terminal UI with real-time updates
- **M4**: Production-ready with comprehensive testing
- **M5**: Documentation complete and deployment ready

## Notes
- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology
- Commit code after each completed feature
- Update tasks.md as work progresses
- Log session summaries in logs/context/
