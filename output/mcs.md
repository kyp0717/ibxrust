> This forces Claude to think **modularly**, even if true MCP is not available.

## ðŸ§ª **3. Future Access: Anthropic might release full MCP to devs**
If you're building tools or work at a company using Claude via API, you might:
- Use **Claude with tool-usage APIs** and give it project context (file tree, indexed symbols)
- Upload ZIPs or tarballs via partner tools
- Await formal IDE plugin integrations (like VS Code extensions powered by Claude)

## âœ… TL;DR: How to "use" MCP

| Action | Method |
|--------|--------|
| Want **automatic MCP** | Use Claude in a **partner IDE or dev-focused interface** that enables it |
| Want **simulated MCP** | Structure prompts with **clearly labeled file/module content** |
| Want **real project refactoring** | Feed codebase snippets in chunks and ask for reasoning across them |
| Want **MCP via API** | Use Claude API with structured multi-part inputs and memory persistence |

If you tell me what environment or project you're in (Claude.ai, local code, etc.), I can show you the **best MCP-style prompt** for it.
